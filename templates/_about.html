      Hello! My name is Theodore Williams. I am a biologist, lover of foxes,
      and for the past year, a software developer. I started learning to code
      in 2017 to become a software developer and I am loving every minute of it.
      I really enjoy problem solving and figuring out how I can use
      new techniques and technologies to build useful applications.
      Thus far, I have concentrated my efforts on developing in Python with
      recent focus on the Django web framework.
      I recently attended the PyCon, 2018 Python conference in Cleveland
      where I met a lot of the Python community, a fantastic group of
      people doing really cool work. After hearing about all the latest
      updates and newest technologies and libraries, I'm really excited to
      work on my projects with new ideas and a fresh perspective.

      A bit about me. I am an intensely curious individual -- I want to know how things work.
      I am a hard worker with a passion for
      developing intriguing software applications.
      I'm excited for challenges and I love to learn new languages,
      libraries and project designs.
      Regardless of the project I'm working on, I like to spend time
      keeping informed of the latest technologies,
      and I'm always looking for how to inject new concepts and ideas into my
      projects. I am a team player who is easy to get along with. I love
      learning from others and teaching new concepts I've learned to those
      interested. Please feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to talk
      about a project, a problem, or anything code or biology related.
