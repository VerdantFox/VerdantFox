  <h1 class="text-center">Twisted Towers</h1>
  <p class="text-justify">
    I wrote this game as my final project for Harvard's course, <a class="link-target" href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x" target="_blank">
    CS50</a>, and I'd
    call it my first program written completely independently. It helped me get
    a sense of how to transition to object-oriented programming, as opposed to
    the procedural programming I'd learned up to that point. Twisted
    Towers is a <a class="link-target" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense" target="_blank">
    tower defense</a> style game that I wrote with Python's Pygame library.
  </p>
  <p class="text-justify">
    The goal of the game is to build and upgrade towers to shoot at the oncoming
    horde of enemies travelling along the path trying to destroy your castle.
    Earn money by killing monsters and use that money to build more towers and
    upgrade your towers into powerful elemental towers to continue fighting
    off the ever-growing horde.

  <p class="text-justify">
    Twisted towers is a desktop application run as a .exe file. To play,
    download the game as a zip file using the link provided. Then, extract
    the files and open the "Game Files" folder. Within this folder is a file
    named "main.exe" (not main.py). Click this program to run the game.
  </p>
  <p class="text-justify">
    Note: Unfortunately this game was written with fixed dimensions and
    will require a monitor height of 760 pixels or greater to display properly.
