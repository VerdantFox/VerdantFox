  <h1 class="text-center">Welcome to connect 4!</h1>
  <br>
  <p class="text-justify">
    Who doesn't enjoy a good board game? Test your wit against Mr. Roboto,
    the simple AI I built for this game. I wrote connect 4 in python. As you
    make your moves, information about your move choice and the board's
    status is sent via AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) back to the
    python code located on the server. Then, your move is processed,
    Mr. Roboto's counter-move is processed, win conditions are checked, and
    everything gets sent back with updated data for the game board. Since,
    this server talk is asynchronous, we don't need to reload this whole
    page for every move, just the game board. Fun!
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-center">How to play:</h2>
  <p class="text-justify">
    <strong>The object of the game is to connect four of your chips in a
    row!</strong> For this game, you will play the red chips and your
    opponent, Mr. Roboto, will play the blue chips. You can place chips
    into columns using the buttons 1-7 located at the top of each column.
    When you click a button, your red chip will fall to the lowest available
    grey circle. Then, in in the blink of an eye, Mr. Roboto will choose
    where to drop his blue chip. His and your most recent chip drops are
    denoted by yellow rings around those chips. If you are able to
    <strong>connect 4</strong> chips in a row (vertically, horizontally,
    or diagonally), you win! If Mr. Roboto connects 4 chips though, he wins!
    The board can be reset with the button located below the board.
    <strong>Good luck!</strong>
