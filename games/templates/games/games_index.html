  <h1>Games!</h1>
  <p class="text-justify">
    Games are fun! They are fun to build and fun to play. They can be an
    exciting conduit to learning new programming languages or new programming
    techniques. Here are a couple of games I've built over the course learning
    to program that have allowed me to learn interesting new concepts.
  </p>
  <h3>Batty's Moth Hunt</h3>
  <p class="text-justify">
    This was the first game and one of the first programs I ever wrote. It's
    written in <a class="link-target" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">
    Scratch</a>, a learner programming language created by MIT. If you have
    someone interested in programming, I highly recommend pointing them to this
    language as a first try. It was a fun experience that got me excited to
    learn more programming with more useful languages.

  <h3>Twisted Towers</h3>
  <p class="text-justify">
    I wrote this game as my final project for Harvard's course, <a class="link-target" href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x" target="_blank">
    CS50</a>, and I'd
    call it my first program written completely independently. It helped me get
    a sense of how to transition to object-oriented programming, as opposed to
    the procedural programming I'd learned up to that point. Twisted
    Towers is a <a class="link-target" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense" target="_blank">
    tower defense</a> style game that I wrote with Python's Pygame library.
